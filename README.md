● Add a standard navbar on the top with search feature which will search from the cards below 
● Create a Index page where the Cards of Movies will be visible.  
● These cards will be in 2 pages, add parameter to url to get page number  page number 1 data from API’s URI: http://task.auditflo.in/1.json  page number 2 data from API’s URI: http://task.auditflo.in/2.json  The above API returns Movies with their IMDBID  
● When clicked on a card It should show details of the movie on a different page with id in parameter, include a back button to return to previous list page.
